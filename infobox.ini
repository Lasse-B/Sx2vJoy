[Profiles]
1  = You can select which profile to modify as well as set up new profiles.
2  = Delete Selected Profile...
3  = As the button name suggests, this deletes the selected profile.
4  = Profile Activation Method
5  = "None (default profile)" disables all profile activation settings, making "default" the only active profile at any time.
6  = "As (last) set in GUI" activates the profile that is currently selected in the GUI. The profile also stays active if the GUI is closed.
7  = "Always Active" forces the specified profile to stay active at all times, no matter what application you're currently working with. If other applications are also flagged with "Always Active", they get overridden to "Off".
8  = "For Specific application" marks the profile to be activated automatically when the application you selected becomes active.
9  = "Off" turns off any automatic profile selecting or profile forcing for the selected profile.
10 = "Rename Profile..."
11 = Click this to rename the currently selected profile.
12 = "Choose Application" and the "Choose / Delete" button
13 = With these you can select an application to go with the "For Specific Application" profile application outlined above. Likewise, if you already have selected an application and wish to change or remove the link to it, this same button lets you do this.
14 = "New Profile..."
15 = To set up a new profile.
16 = "Show if Active"
17 = Choose whether or not to display the name of a profile upon its activation.
18 = Works only in games not running in true fullscreen mode.

[Assign Axes]
1  = Lets you set up which axes of your 3DConnexion device are linked to which axes on the vJoy virtual Joystick.
2  = Each vJoy axis may be assigned only once.

[Assign Buttons]
1  = Lets you select which device to start the buttons set up dialog for.

[Deadzone (%)]
1  = Examples:
2  = 0% = no deadzone
3  = 100% = deadzone all across the axis
4  = Defines an area around the center of the handle of your 3DConnexion device's handle in which all movement is ignored.

[Invert]
1  = Examples:
2  = unticked = axis behaves normally
3  = ticked = axis is inverted
4  = Invert axis movement. Left becomes right, up becomes down, or vice versa.

[Convert Axis]
1  = Examples:
2  = no (off) = axis behaves normally
3  = 3DC controller = axis on the controller behaves like a throttle
4  = mousewheel = throttle control is given to the mousewheel
5  = Relative axis movement. Sets a virtual axis to behave like a throttle.
6  = Moving the physical handle makes the virtual axis deflection increase, but letting go of the physical handle doesn't make it decrease. For that you have to move the physical handle in the opposite direction.
7  = WARNING!
8  = If set to mousewheel, even when using the mousewheel to navigate scroll bars in games will it affect the throttle. To zero the throttle, click the mousehweel.

[Increments (%)]
1  = Examples:
2  = 2 = throttle changes by 2% per notch
3  = 5 = throttle changes by 5% per notch
4  = This is for operating the throttle axis via the mousewheel. With it you can fine tune throttle adjustments. A setting of 2 would make it so you'd need to scroll through 50 notches to get from one end of the throttle to the other. A setting of 10 would require 10 notches.

[Zero Throttle at %]
1  = Examples:
2  = 50 = zero throttle point at 50% of the virtual axis range
3  = 20 = zero throttle point at one fifth of the virtual axis range
4  = Some games may use the throttle in such a way that you can use it to go forward as well as backward. Set this to where on the virtual axis the game expects the throttle to be when in its zero position.

[Pitch]
1  = Examples:
2  = 1 = 1:1 axis mapping
3  = 0 = axis is completely dead
4  = 2 = vJoy axis moves twice as fast
5  = Ideally you have one end of the green graph touch the lower left corner, while the other end of the graph touches the upper right corner.
6  = Can be combined with curvature and exponent.

[Curvature (%)]
1  = Examples:
2  = 0% = straight graph
3  = 100% = strongest curvature
4  = Starts with decreased sensitivity around the center of the handle and dynamically increases sensitivity based on how far you moved the handle from its center position.
5  = Ideal if you want to be able to do precision adjustments near the center of the handle but retain the ability for more forceful maneuvers further out.
6  = Can be combined with pitch and exponent.

[Exponent]
1  = Examples:
2  = 3 = standard behavior
3  = 5 = curve starts flatter but gets even steeper further out
4  = Allows you to further adapt axis output translation to your needs by putting the curve further down the graph. Basically, the higher the exponent, the more precision you have around the center of the handle. But you buy that with less precision in the outer areas.
5  = Notes:
6  = Only odd integers are saved.
7  = Can be combined with pitch and curvature.
8  = Please also read the info on curvature.

[Graph]
1  = Display(ing) Graph for Axis
2  = This has two functions. It lets you select which axis' graph to view if you click one of the radio buttons. If you make changes to Pitch, Curvature or Exponent, it'll show you which axis you last made changes to.
3  = Graph Precision (explanation)
4  = As you experiment with bigger exponents (>9), you may find the graph doesn't reach the corners anymore. This is just an optical effect and doesn't influence how Sx2vJoy works.

[Button Configurator]
1  = Here you can set up whether pressing a button on your 3DConnexion controller sends a joystick button press or a keyboard button press.
2  = Select an option from the drop down menu for each 3DC button ID you want to assign a command to and you'll be guided through the rest of the process.

[Set Keyboard Input]
1  = Here you can set up which keyboard command to send when pushing the corresponding button on your 3DConnexion controller.

[Modifier Buttons]
1  = Select which button or button combination to use as modifier keys. "Left" means the left version of a button on your keyboard, while "right" means the right version. If you tick both left and right, a generic event not bound to left or right will be generated for that button.


[Normal Buttons]
1  = Simply press the keyboard button you want your 3DConnexion's button to send. If the field stays empty, try to find it in the drop down menu in the "Special Buttons" section.
2  = Is on numbers block?
3  = Some buttons like numbers or math operators can be found on the main part of a keyboard as well as on the numbers block. In such a case, if you want to have a button sent as part of the numbers block, just check the corresponding box.

[Special Buttons]
1  = Here you can set up to send any button that is not a single character, like F1, Enter, Esc, Insert and so on.
2  = Is on numbers block?
3  = Some buttons like numbers or math operators can be found on the main part of a keyboard as well as on the numbers block. In such a case, if you want to have a button sent as part of the numbers block, just check the corresponding box.
